Sticky Note App ðŸ“‹ The Sticky Note App is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize virtual sticky notes. It is designed to emulate the functionality of traditional sticky notes with additional modern features, such as customizable colors, drag-and-drop reordering, and timestamps for tracking edits.

Delete All Notes: Remove all notes with a simple delete button.

Technologies Used 1.HTML: For creating the structure of the application. 2.CSS: For styling and layout. 3.JavaScript (DOM Manipulation): For implementing interactive functionalities such as note creation, drag-and-drop, timestamp updates, and color customization.
